# gBoards: Docs

Welcome! If you're here, you've probably picked up one of my boards and are trying 
to figure it out. Good on you! Hit the nav for anything you need otherwise reach out

The Combo/Chording Engine docs can be found over at [combos.gboards.ca](http://combos.gboards.ca/)
Currently I'm migrating boards over to this new system.
